# **Multi-label ECG Abnormality Classification Using A Combined ResNet-DenseNet Architecture with ResU Blocks**   
   
This is an official repo of the paper "**Multi-label ECG Abnormality Classification Using A Combined ResNet-DenseNet Architecture with ResU Blocks**," which is submitted to IEEE EMBS International Conference on Data Science and Engineering in Healthcare, Medicine & Biology.   

**Abstract**ï¼šElectrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality classification is to detect various types of clinical abnormalities from ECG. 
This paper proposes a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based ECG abnormality classification based on an architecture where ResNet and DenseNet are cascaded.
ResNet in the proposed architecture comprises a residual U-shaped (ResU) block that effectively captures multi-scale feature maps without significantly increasing parameters.
In addition, we use a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) to ensure that the model focuses better on clinically essential features in the given ECG.
Experimental results show that our proposed model performs superior ECG abnormality classification performance to other recently proposed DNN-based models.

## Requirements 
This repo is tested with Ubuntu 22.04, PyTorch 2.0.1, Python3.10, and CUDA11.7. For package dependencies, you can install them by:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt    
```   


## Getting started    
1. Install the necessary libraries.   
2. Download the PhysioNet Challenge 2021 database and place it in '../Dataset/' folder.   
```
